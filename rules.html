        <h3>Hogwarts grounds</h3>
        <p>Students are not allowed to leave the Hogwarts grounds.
            Any student 3rd year and above may go on weekend trips to Hogsmeade, however, this is with a parent/guardian slip granting students such privileges. Without that, students are to remain on school grounds.
            Weekend trips start on Friday after classes (4:30pm MT) until curfew (10:00pm MT) of which they are expected to be back in their dorms at Hogwarts. On Saturday and Sunday, they may leave after breakfast (10:00am MT) and must be back by curfew (10:00pm MT) the same day.
            Additionally, students with a good reason to leave along with Headmaster/mistress's permission along with a parent slip may also leave even if it is not a weekend.
            Visitors that are not students or staff must obtain permission from the Headmaster or Headmistress before stepping on to the property, this includes parents and ministry personnel.
            The only exception are to members of the Hogwarts Board of Governors whom have free access to the school.</p>
            <h3>Faculty areas</h3>
        <p>Students are forbidden from entering any and all faculty areas (Kitchen area, faculty lounge, offices) without the expressed permission of the professor or faculty member along with being escorted to the area by another faculty member to ensure there are people to monitor on you.
            Note that the rule above also applies to classrooms when they are not in session.
            The only people who may break this rule are Perfects whom are checking the area for those who are breaking the rules.
            Upon being allowed, you are expected to deal with the matter you are set to meet for and after you are done with your meeting head straight to the student allowed areas. Failure to do so will lead to consequences.
            Any and all property within classrooms should be left alone as well, there will be no stealing of tests or placing forged tests in a pile of graded or to be graded papers.</p>
            <h3>House areas</h3>
            <p>House common rooms and dormitories are restricted to house members alone. Visitors are not allowed to either the dorms or the common rooms and meetings must be according to that rule.
                Example being a Hufflepuff and Slytherin are friends, however, when figuring out a place to hangout both will have to go to a non-dorm/common room area due to a) not knowing where it is and b) it is against the School Rules.
                Boys are not allowed to enter the girls dormitories along with the roles being reversed. There is a spell in place that will cause a trap door to be opened and will bring the offender to the Headmaster/mistresses office.
                The only exception is if a Prefect is needing to get into a place due to an emergency</p>
